# Kiosk Client

Kiosk Client is the base to interact/manage a kiosk.

## Creating a Kiosk Client

You can follow the example to create a `KioskClient`. The client currently supports `MAINNET` and
`TESTNET`.

_Mysten Kiosk rules & extensions are not supported in devnet due to network wipes (that would
require constantly changing the package ids)._

```typescript
import { SuiClient, getFullnodeUrl } from '@mysten/sui.js/client';
import { KioskClient, Network } from '@mysten/kiosk';

// We need a Sui Client. You can re-use the SuiClient of your project
// (it's not recommended to create a new one).
const client = new SuiClient({ url: getFullnodeUrl('testnet') });

// Now we can use it to create a kiosk Client.
const kioskClient = new KioskClient({
	client,
	network: Network.TESTNET,
});
```

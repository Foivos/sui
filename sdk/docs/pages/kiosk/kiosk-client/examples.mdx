# Examples

Here are some more complete examples on how you'd use the SDK to interact, and we'll focus on dApps.

## Minting into kiosk example

For every scenario when we're using Kiosk in dApps, the user who has connected their wallet will either have a kiosk already (and could have more than one)
or we will have to create it for them.

The SDK supports the scenarios of `silently` creating the kiosk, as part of our PTBs.


### When the user has a kiosk

```typescript

// let's assume that we have created the client somewhere else.
const kioskClient = new KioskClient({...});
const connectedAddress = '0xAnAddress';

// This function should run when the user connects the wallet. 
// We should re-use the same `KioskClient` instance throughout our dApp.
const prepareClient = async () => {
    let { kioskOwnerCaps } = await kioskClient.getOwnedKiosks(address);
    // let's assume that the user has only 1 kiosk.
    // Here, we would need to do some more checks in a realistic scneario. 
    // And also possible give the user in our dApp a selector for which kiosk he wants to interact with
    // (if he owns more than 1).
    kioskClient.setSelectedCap(kioskOwnerCaps[0])
}

// Now our mint function would be like:
const mint = async () => {
    const txb = new TransactionBlock();

    // This would work in both personal and non-personal kiosks.
    await kioskClient.ownedKioskTx(txb, async (kiosk, cap) => {
        let coin = txb.splitCoins(txb.gas, [tx.pure(1_000_000_000)]);
        // We'll assume it costs 1 SUI
        txb.moveCall({
            target: '0xMyGame::hero::mint',
            arguments: [
                coin, // the payment
                kiosk, // our kiosk
                cap // the owner Cap.
            ]
        });
    });
    // now we can continue to sign & execute the transaction.
}
```

### When the user doesn't have a kiosk

```typescript
// let's assume that we have created the client somewhere else.
const kioskClient = new KioskClient({...});

// Our mint function.
const mint = async () => {
    // let's assume this is the connected address. If we were using wallet-kit, that would be `currentAccount?.address`.
    const connectedAddress = '0xAnAddress';
    const txb = new TransactionBlock();

    const [kiosk, cap] = kioskClient.create(txb);

    // now let's mint a hero.
    let coin = txb.splitCoins(txb.gas, [tx.pure(1_000_000_000)]);
    // We'll assume it costs 1 SUI
    txb.moveCall({
        target: '0xMyGame::hero::mint',
        arguments: [
            coin, // the payment
            kiosk, // our kiosk
            cap // the cap
        ]
    });
    
    // We need to share + transfer the cap for the newly created kiosk.
    txb.shareAndTransferCap(txb, kiosk, cap, connectedAddress);

    // we can now signAndExecute the transaction!
}
```

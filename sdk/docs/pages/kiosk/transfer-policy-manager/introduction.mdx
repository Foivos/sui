# Transfer Policy Manager

Transfer Policy Client is a way to easily manage a Transfer Policy. It allows to create a transfer
policy, attach or remove rules from it and withdraw profits.

It is decoupled from the Kiosk Client, as this tool is specifically for creators, to easily create a
transfer policy, add or remove rules from it and withdraw profits.

## Creating a Transfer Policy Manager

You can follow the example to create a `TransferPolicyManager`. The client currently supports
`MAINNET` and `TESTNET`.

_Mysten Kiosk rules & extensions are not supported in devnet due to network wipes (that would
require constantly changing the package ids)._

```typescript
import { SuiClient, getFullnodeUrl } from '@mysten/sui.js/client';
import { TransferPolicyManager, Network } from '@mysten/kiosk';

// We need a Sui Client. You can re-use the SuiClient of your project
// (it's not recommended to create a new one).
const client = new SuiClient({ url: getFullnodeUrl('testnet') });

// Now we can use it to create a transfer policy manager.
const transferPolicyManager = new TransferPolicyManager({
	client,
	network: Network.TESTNET,
});
```
